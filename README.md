•	Conducted system-level and sub-component-level static and dynamic finite element analysis for fatigue and NVH simulations, improving product performance, lifecycle, and quality through design changes.
•	Performed design topology optimization studies for electronic motors and gearboxes, ensuring best practices.
•	Collaborated with stakeholders to enhance customer current products and develop new ones. 
•	Prepared comprehensive technical reports and delivered client presentations, translating technical data into actionable insights. 
•	Managed customer support system (Salesforce Service Cloud, JIRA Atlassian & Confluence Atlassian) to provide timely and effective solutions.
•	Utilized JIRA to create and manage project timelines, assign tasks, and track progress, ensuring all projects milestones were met on time. 
•	Worked with cross-functional teams across the U.S., India, and Europe, promoting global cooperation and customer satisfaction. 

#### Software Application Engineer Intern - Systems Dynamics, Hexagon Manufacturing Intelligence, Novi, MI	Jun 2022 - Dec 2022
•	Designed basic rotating machinery systems and conducted gear stress analysis using Romax DT.
•	Performed gearbox normal mode NVH (Noise, Vibration, and Harshness) analysis with Romax DT and MSC Adams View, comparing eigenvalue and eigenvector solutions.
 
#### Graduate Research Assistant, Columbia University, New York, NY	Feb 2022 - Dec 2022
•	Modeled 3D CAD microscope test tools for nano-optics research using SolidWorks.
•	Prepared tessellated crystal particles and exfoliated the particles on silicon wafers to achieve single/multiple layers for microscopy experiments.
•	Operated PECVD (Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition) to create 1064nm and 800nm SiO2/Si3N4 dielectric Bragg reflectors and ran spectroscopic ellipsometry to measure thickness and refractive index.
 
#### Quality Engineer & Warranty Analyst, Kwangjin America, (Tier 1 supplier for GM, Ford, FCA & VW), Warren, MI	Jan 2014 - Jan 2021
•	Led FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) evaluation, durability, design proposals, case studies, and chemical component reports for eight new vehicle window regulators, securing APQP (Advanced Product Quality Planning) approvals.
•	Maintained and updated PPAP (Production Part Approval Process) including MSA (Measurement System Analysis) and SPC (Statistical Process Control) for 15 vehicle window regulator engineering changes.
•	Analyzed process capabilities and production capability studies with Gage R&R and A/B comparison tests to enhance window regulator performance, functionality, manufacturability, and product quality.
•	Validated simulation results from FEA (Finite Element Analysis) with experimental test data such as photo image inspection and UTM (Universal Testing Machine) for 21 different vehicle window regulator data sets.
•	Audited DFMEA (Design Failure Mode and Effects Analysis), PFMEA (Process Failure Mode and Effects Analysis), manufacturing and prototype control plans, and work instructions to meet ISO 9001 standards.
•	Assisted customers in root cause analysis at vehicle manufacturing plants and implemented corrective actions, leading cross-functional teams in weekly meetings for root cause analysis and solution implementation.
•	Reported business status, customer trends, and quality issues to the top management weekly.
